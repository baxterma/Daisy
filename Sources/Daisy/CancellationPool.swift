// MARK: - CancellationPool

/// A cancellation pool is used to collect a series of `Cancellable` items, where they can later
/// be cancelled without needing to manually store a collection of the aforementioned items.
/// A cancellation pool stores weak references to the items added to it.
///
/// Items can either be added to a cancellation pool manually, or by passing a cancellation pool to any of the
/// `start(running:)` or chaining families of functions. 
///
/// To cancel the items in a cancellation pool, call `drain()`. This asks the items in the pool to cancel, and removes
/// them from the pool. 
///
/// - note: If some of the items in a cancellation pool are in a state where they cannot be cancelled,
/// (e.g. they have already finished their work), they will still be sent the `attemptCancel()` message, and it is up to
/// the receiver in this case to do nothing (as per the documentation for `Cancellable`).
